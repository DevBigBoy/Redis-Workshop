# Redis Workshop

Welcome to the Redis Workshop! This workshop is designed to provide an in-depth understanding of Redis, a fast, in-memory data structure store widely used as a database, cache, and message broker. Redis is known for its flexibility, simplicity, and performance, making it an ideal tool for many applications.

## Workshop Overview

### Workshop Goals

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Understand the core principles and use cases of Redis.
- Use various Redis data structures and commands.
- Build high-performance, real-time applications leveraging Redis.
- Implement Redis as a caching layer to improve application performance.
- Understand Redis' persistence, replication, and clustering capabilities.

### Prerequisites

To follow along with this workshop, participants should have a basic understanding of:

- Databases (especially NoSQL databases)
- Basic command-line usage
- Fundamental programming concepts

### Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Redis**
   - What is Redis?
   - Key features and architecture
   - Redis use cases: caching, session management, real-time analytics, pub/sub, etc.
   - Redis data structures overview

2. **Core Data Structures and Commands**
   - **Strings**: Set, Get, Append, Increment/Decrement, and String length operations.
   - **Lists**: Pushing/popping elements, retrieving elements by index or range, using lists as queues/stacks.
   - **Sets**: Adding, removing, checking membership, and performing set operations (union, intersection, difference).
   - **Hashes**: Storing and accessing structured data, working with fields and values.
   - **Sorted Sets**: Adding elements with scores, ranking, and retrieving ranges.
   - **Bitmaps** and **HyperLogLogs**: Advanced data types for specific use cases.

3. **Working with Expirations and TTL (Time to Live)**
   - Expiring keys automatically with TTL commands
   - Using Redis as an ephemeral data store for sessions and caching

4. **Redis Persistence**
   - Different persistence methods: RDB (snapshotting) and AOF (Append-Only File)
   - Configuring Redis persistence for data durability
   - Pros and cons of each persistence mode

5. **Redis as a Cache**
   - Caching strategies with Redis
   - Implementing caching in applications
   - Key eviction policies (e.g., LRU, LFU, volatile, allkeys, no eviction)
   - Use cases: session caching, database query caching, content caching

6. **Redis Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe)**
   - Understanding the publish/subscribe messaging pattern
   - Real-time messaging and communication with Pub/Sub
   - Practical applications: chat systems, notification systems, and more

7. **Redis Transactions and Atomicity**
   - Understanding transactions in Redis with MULTI, EXEC, WATCH, and DISCARD
   - Using optimistic locking with WATCH for concurrency control
   - Limitations of Redis transactions and workarounds

8. **Replication and High Availability**
   - Configuring Redis replication for data redundancy
   - Understanding master-slave architecture
   - Automatic failover with Redis Sentinel
   - Basics of Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling

9. **Introduction to Redis Streams (Advanced)**
   - Overview of the Redis Stream data structure
   - Stream commands: adding entries, reading entries, consumer groups
   - Use cases: logging systems, event-driven architectures

10. **Redis Security and Best Practices**
    - Configuring Redis security settings (authentication, access control)
    - Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
    - Securing Redis in production environments

11. **Monitoring and Tuning Performance**
    - Monitoring Redis performance with built-in commands (INFO, MONITOR)
    - Key metrics to watch: memory usage, command latency, keyspace hits/misses
    - Configuring Redis for high performance and tuning common settings

12. **Hands-On Exercises and Labs**
    - Each section will include practical exercises and labs to reinforce concepts.
    - Real-world scenarios to apply Redis to caching, Pub/Sub messaging, and data storage.
